```bash
# Container management
docker run [IMAGE]              # Run a container
docker ps                       # List running containers
docker ps -a                    # List all containers
docker stop [CONTAINER]         # Stop a container
docker start [CONTAINER]        # Start a container
docker rm [CONTAINER]           # Remove a container
docker logs [CONTAINER]         # View container logs

# Image management
docker images                   # List images
docker build -t [TAG] .         # Build image
docker pull [IMAGE]             # Pull image from registry
docker push [IMAGE]             # Push image to registry
docker rmi [IMAGE]              # Remove image

# System management
docker system df                # Show disk usage
docker system prune             # Clean up unused resources

docker ps

# Use a different port
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx  # Change 8080 to another port
```

### Container Name Conflict
```bash
# Remove existing container
docker rm -f [CONTAINER_NAME]

# Or use a different name
docker run --name myapp-v2 nginx
```

### Cannot Connect to Docker Daemon
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- On Linux: `sudo systemctl start docker`

### Out of Disk Space
